# Capstone Custom Internal Chatbot Referencing an Azure Search Index

## Project Overview (data warehouse and data lake table in appendix here as well)
* PROBLEM: Server information is often scattered across data lakes, data warehouses, inventory records, and online documentation, making it time-consuming and difficult to access when needed.
* SOLUTION: We created a web application to use as a front-end LLM prompt and response interface so that users can quickly retrieve needed information.
